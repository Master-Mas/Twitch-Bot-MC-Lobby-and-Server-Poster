### How do I get set up? ###

To run the program you double click it. Doesn't need to be installed or anything.

You will need the following for the program:

* The Twitch Username that the bot will be posting under. This could be a separate account or your main account
* The OAuth key for that account. It's like a password but different. This can be obtained from [Twitch Apps](http://twitchapps.com/tmi/)
* The Twitch username that the bot will be posting under. So if your the channel your live streaming on is http://twitch.tv/master_mas then the Twitch username is master_mas

Once done you can select if you would like the program to save your settings for next time.
You then can click 'Start Bot' If the status message changes to a Green 'Bot Connected and Running' then the bot is working.
If the app never changes to that state then it means something is wrong in the details.

**Make sure you start the program before you join a server otherwise it will never print any messages out**

To exit the program click the exit button and the bot will auto close itself.

### Once it's running ###
Once the program is running whenever you change lobbies, exit a mingame or join one, etc the program will tell Twitch chat of which lobby or minigame on which server you are.

## Commands ##
* !server - Will post out the current server you're on
* !lobby - Will post out the current minigame or lobby you are in

## Caution ##
* **Never join a server that you don't want to release the ip of. It will auto post it before you know it.**
